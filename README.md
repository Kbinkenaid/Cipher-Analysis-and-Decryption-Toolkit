# Cryptographic-
Description-->
CryptoPhaseTwo is a Java-based program designed to analyze encrypted text using the following features:

Frequency Analysis: Analyzes the occurrences of single letters, digrams (two-letter combinations), and trigrams (three-letter combinations) in the ciphertext.
Reverse Caesar Cipher: Decodes the ciphertext using all 26 reverse Caesar cipher shifts.
Dictionary Matching: Identifies meaningful words in the decoded text by matching them with a dictionary.
This program is useful for understanding cryptanalysis techniques and breaking simple encryption methods like Caesar ciphers.
